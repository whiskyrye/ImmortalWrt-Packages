## Overview

LuCI Bandix Plus is a LuCI frontend for `bandix-plus`, designed for OpenWrt traffic monitoring and rate control.
Compared with `luci-app-bandix`, **LuCI Bandix Plus focuses on multi-interface scenarios**.


This project provides a web UI under **Network → Bandix Plus** to view and manage:

- Multi-interface monitoring and management
- Interface overview (upload / download)
- Device list and usage ranking
- Traffic timeline and historical statistics
- Interface rate limits
- Scheduled rate limits
- Guest control rules and whitelist

Typical interfaces include physical ports, VLAN sub-interfaces, PPPoE WAN, and VPN/tunnel interfaces.
